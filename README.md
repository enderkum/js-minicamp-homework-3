# Homework #3

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* Objects    : They are containers for named values called properties or methods. A property can be a string or an array and a function in a object is named as method.  
	* Properties : They are the values associated with a JavaScript object.
	* methods    : Actions that can be performed on objects.
	* for in loop: It loops through the properties of an object. The block of code inside the loop will be executed once for each property.
	* dot notation vs bracket notation : dot notation is more common for indicating properties of an object, however we should use bracket notation in a function where we pass a variable as parameter. 


2. Fork and clone this repo.  When you need to commit use the following commands.
		
	* git status
	* git add --all
	* git status
	* git commit -m "your commit message"
	* git push origin master

3. Install dependencies using `npm install`.  Run tests using `npm test`.
